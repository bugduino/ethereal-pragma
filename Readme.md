# Pragma - Trustless lending made easy

Live demo on Rinkeby (best on Desktop): [https://bugduino.github.io/ethereal-pragma](https://bugduino.github.io/ethereal-pragma)

This is a PoC for the Ethereal Hackathon

It allows you to easily lend ETH on the Compound v2 protocol,
by connecting your favourite wallet.

Thanks to the Fortmatic integration
earning interests on the blockchain has never been easier, with
just a phone number you can seamlessly interact with Compound without installing
extensions or downloading third party apps

Start earning a whopping 27% APR today! (it's on Rinkeby remember?
:neckbeard: )

### Next features to be added:
- DAI integration
- better UI
- Other lending options other than Compound (Dharma, Nuo.networks, dx/dy, ...)
- direct fiat-to-crypto gateway :shipit:

In this interaction no wrapper contract is needed, it's only a client app. In future
versions a contract wrapper may be added

### Built with
- truffle-react
- web3-react (for Fortmatic, Metamask, Trezor and Ledger integration)
- rimble-ui


**Note: The repo is a little mess as it was hacked up in about 3-4 days, it needs a refactor.
